/*
Using array this problem can be solved by multiple methods.

0 -> First we will sort the array and then using brute force we will match the a[i] and a[i+1]
    elements. Complexity will be O(nlogn);

1 -> It can be done without sorting. We will use two for loops but the complexity of the solution
    will increase to O(n^2);

2 -> In this method we will use count array and we will count the occurence of elements in the array.
    If it is more than one we will print it and the complexity will be reduced to O(n);

3 -> There are more methods to do it. But the best to do it with array will give O(n) as the best
    complexity;
